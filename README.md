# Simple House Price Prediction Model Using Linear Regression:

This project implements a multivariable linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, age of the house, lot size, garage size, pool availability, school district rating, distance from the center of the city and amenities available. The model is trained using historical housing data to learn the relationship between these features and the house price. After training, the model is tested using the testing input data. 

The model score evaluated is: **0.8319605187275415**. 

This means **83.19%** of the variation in house prices is captured by the model. 

The Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is: **38677.76080547994**

The Mean Squared Error(MSE) is: **2470307482.591854**
